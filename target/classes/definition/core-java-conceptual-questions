Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A programming language is a computer language that is used by programmers to communicate with computers.

What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
The JDK contains a private Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and a few other resources such as an interpreter(Java),
a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc) etc. to complete the development of a
Java Application.
What is IDE?
IDE is stand for Integrated development environment. IDE is a software for building application that combined common
developer tools into a single graphical user
interface.

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
Eclipse, Intellij IDEA and Visual studio.

Explain the entire java life cycle.
After typing the program in a text-editor, we have to save the file with .java extension. It is a good convention to
save the file with the name of the class.

Second step is compilation. The name of the Java compiler is javac. The input to the compiler is Java source code
which is available in Sample.java. The output of the compiler is machine independent or platform independent code
which is known as byte code. The file which is generated after compilation is .class file.

Last step is execution. The byte code generated by the compiler will be executed by Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

what is class?
Class is a collection of variables (attributes) and methods (Behaviors). Object is an instance of the clas.
What is object?
An object can be defined as an instance of a class, and there can be multiple instances of a class in a program.
What is the entry point of an application?
An application entry point identifies a resource that is an access point to an application.
Why main is static?
The main() method is static because its convenient for the JDK.
Which class is the superclass of all classes?
The class named Object is the super class of every class in Java.
What is difference between path and classpath variables?
The main difference between path and classpath is that Path is set for java tools in java programs like java and javac,
which are used to compile your code. Whereas classpath  is used by System or Application class loader to locate and
load compile Java byte codes stored in the .class file.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
Interface:
1.Interface can have only abstract methods.
2.Interface supports multiple inheritance.
3.Interface has only static and final variables.
Abstract class:
1.Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
2.Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance.
3.Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables.
We cannot create an object of abstract class or interface since they are incomplete class but we can do is to
implement a subclass of abstract class which, of course, must not be abstract.

what is Access Specifier?
Access modifiers are keywords that can be used to control the visibility of fields, methods, and constructors in
a class. The four access modifiers in Java are public, protected, default, and private.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
It is a programming concept that works on the principles of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance,
and polymorphism and that’s why it’s called OOPs (Object Oriented Programming System).

Abstraction:Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

Encapsulation: The meaning of encapsulation is to make sure that sensitive data is hidden from users.

Inheritance:Inheritance in Java is the method to create a hierarchy between classes by inheriting from other classes.

Polymorphism: A single object can refer to the super- class or sub-class depending on the reference type which is
called polymorphism.
For example, think of a superclass called Car that has a method called CarModel(). Subclasses of Car could be Honda,
BMW, Mazda, Audi - And they also have their own implementation of a car model (Honda, CRV, and BMW X-5, etc.)


What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
In Java, two packages java. lang package and default package are imported by default in all the classes of Java.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
Application Programming Interface (API) is a software interface that allows two applications to interact with each
other without any user intervention.
1.Twitter Bots
2.Log-In Using XYZ
3.Weather Snippers
4.Pay with PayPal
5.Google Maps
6.Travel Booking
7.E-Commerce

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
Java doesn't support multiple inheritances in classes because it can lead to diamond problem.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
Method Overloading allows different methods to have the same name, but different signatures where the signature can
differ by the number of input parameters or type of input parameters, or a mixture of both.
Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
An exception object is an instance of an exception class. It gets created and handed to the Java runtime when an
exceptional event occurred that disrupted the normal flow of the application. This is called “to throw an exception”
because in Java you use the keyword “throw” to hand the exception to the runtime.
What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
The static keyword in Java is used for memory management mainly. We can apply static keyword with variables, methods,
blocks and nested classes. The static keyword belongs to the class than an instance of the class.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
The final keyword is a non-access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods, which makes them non-changeable.

What is final, finally and finalize?
Final:Final is a keyword and is used as access modifier in Java.
Finally:Finally is a block in Java used for Exception Handling.
Finalize:Finalize is a method in Java used for Garbage Collection.

What is a constructor ?
A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A class can have multiple constructors that assign the fields in different ways.
If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
If a class does not explicitly declare any, the Java compiler automatically provides a no-argument constructor,
called the default constructor.
What is "this" keyword in java ?
The “this” keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
The super keyword refers to super class (parent) objects.
Three possible way we can uses of super Keyword in Java:
super can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.
super can be used to invoke immediate parent class method.
super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.
What is JVM stand for ?
Java Virtual Machine
Is JVM platform independent?
Yes.
What version of java are you using?
Java 11.
What is JAR stand for ?
JAR stands for Java ARchive.

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
JDK is a software development kit whereas JVM is an environment for executing bytecode.

JDK is platform dependent, but JVM is not platform independent.

The full form of JDK is Java Development Kit, while the full form of JVM is Java Virtual Machine.

What is the difference between JRE and JVM?
JRE is a software bundle that allows Java program to run, whereas JVM is an environment for executing bytecode.

JRE is also platform dependent, but JVM is not platform independent.

The full form of JRE is Java Runtime Environment, while the full form of JVM is Java Virtual Machine.

What is compile time and run time?
Compile-time errors are the errors that occurred when we write the wrong syntax. And the runtime errors are the errors
that occur during the execution and after compilation.


What is heap?
A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.
How java manage it's memory?
Java uses an automatic memory management system called a garbage collector.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?

1.String is immutable whereas StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable classes.
2.StringBuffer is thread-safe and synchronized whereas StringBuilder is not. That’s why StringBuilder is faster than
StringBuffer.
3.String concatenation operator (+) internally uses StringBuffer or StringBuilder class.

What is Singleton class?
A singleton class is a class that can have only one object (an instance of the class) at a time.
What is Serialization and Deserialization?
Serialization is used to export application data into a file. The destination application then uses deserialization
to extract the data from the application for further use.

When to use transient variable in java?
Transient in Java is used to indicate that a field should not be part of the serialization process.

Difference between while and do..while loop?
The difference between while and do while loop is that in the while loop the condition is checked prior to executing
any statements whereas in the case of do while loop, statements are run at least once, and then the condition
is verified.
What is Enum?
An enum type is a special data type that enables for a variable to be a set of predefined constants.

What is Iterator?
An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections, like ArrayList and HashSet.
Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
As already mentioned int is a primitive data type and takes 32 bits(4 bytes) to store.On other hand Integer is an
object which takes 128 bits (16 bytes) to store its int value.

Why is String Immutable in Java?
The String is immutable in Java because of the security, synchronization and concurrency, caching, and class loading.
What is constructor chaining in Java?
Constructor chaining refers to the ability to call a constructor inside another constructor.
The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
The only difference between serial and parallel garbage collector is that serial garbage collector uses a single
thread for garbage collection process while the parallel garbage collector uses multiple threads for the garbage
collection.
What is JIT stands for?
 Just-in-time
Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
The JVM runtime environment uses a large memory pool called the heap for object allocation. The JVM automatically
invokes garbage collections in order to clean up the heap of unreferenced or dead objects.
Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
No, garbage collection cannot guarantee that your application will not run out of memory.
What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
Stack stores items that have a very short life such as methods, variables, and reference variables of the objects
and it is smaller in size. Whereas heap stores objects and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) classes and it is larger
in size.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
Reflection is a feature in the Java programming language.Java Reflection is a process of examining or modifying the
run time behavior of a class at run time.

what is multithreading in java?
In Java, Multithreading refers to a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously for maximum utilization
of the CPU.
What is the use of synchronization in Java?
Synchronization in java is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource.
What is Framework?
Java Framework is the body or platform of pre-written codes used by Java developers to develop Java applications or
web applications.

What are the testing Framework available in java?

1. Selenium
2. JUnit
3. TestNG
4. SerenityBDD
5. Mockito

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
JUnit is a framework that is open-source and may be used to write and trigger tests and advanced annotation is not
 supported. Whereas testNG is a Java-based framework that provides an improved way to run tests and capable of
 supporting more advanced annotation.

What are the dependencies for this project?
Maven, jUnit, mySQL
what is dependency injection in java?
Dependency injection enables you to turn regular Java classes into managed objects and to inject them into any other
managed object.
What is static binding and dynamic binding?
Static binding: When type of the object is determined at compiled time(by the compiler), it is known as static binding.

Dynamic binding: When type of the object is determined at run-time, it is known as dynamic binding.
