Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:
why do we need data structure?
A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data.


What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
Array, Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph, etc.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Data structures are used in any program or software. They are used in the areas of:
Compiler Design.
Operating System.
DBMS.
Graphics.
Simulation.
Numerical Analysis.

what is an Array?
An array is a collection of items of same data type stored at contiguous memory locations.
what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Array;An array is a dynamically-created object. It serves as a container that holds the constant number of values
of the same type. It has a contiguous memory location.
ArrayList:The ArrayList is a class of Java Collections framework. It contains popular classes like Vector, HashTable,
and HashMap.

what is LinkedList?
A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.
How is an Array different from Linked List?
The major difference between Array and Linked list regards to their structure. Arrays are index based data structure
where each element associated with an index. On the other hand, Linked list relies on references where each node
consists of the data and the references to the previous and next element.

what is queue?
A Queue is defined as a linear data structure that is open at both ends and the operations are performed in First In
First Out (FIFO) order.

what is stack?
Stack stores items that have a very short life such as methods, variables, and reference variables of the objects
and it is smaller in size.
what is FIFO and LIFO?
FIFO (First-In-First-Out) approach in Programming and LIFO (Last-In-Fiest-Out) approach in Programming.

what is the order of complexity?
The most common complexity classes are O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n²).
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
The best case of a search algorithm will be O(1).
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
The worst case of a search algorithm will be O(n).
what is tree in data structure?
A tree data structure is defined as a collection of objects or entities known as nodes that are linked together to
represent or simulate hierarchy.
what is graph in data structure?
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges.
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
HashTable: HashTable is synchronized. It is thread-safe and can be shared with many threads.
HashMap: HashMap is non synchronized. It is not-thread safe and can't be shared between many threads without proper
synchronization code.
What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
RDBMS = Array
Network data model = Graph
Hierarchical data model = Trees
How HashMap works in java?
HashMap stores entries into multiple singly linked lists, called buckets or bins. Default number of bins is 16 and
it’s always power of 2.HashMap uses hashCode() and equals() methods on keys for get and put operations. So HashMap
key object should provide good implementation of these methods. This is the reason immutable classes are better
suitable for keys, for example String and Interger.
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
The ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is a runtime exception in Java that occurs when an array is accessed with an
illegal index.
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Copying element by element
Using the clone() method
Using the System.arraycopy() method
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
Array:An array is a dynamically-created object. It serves as a container that holds the constant number of values
of the same type. It has a contiguous memory location.

Linked list:Linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes. Linked list can be
defined as the nodes that are randomly stored in the memory. A node in the linked list contains two parts,
i.e., first is the data part and second is the address part.
What is DFS and BFS?
The full form of BFS is Breadth-First Search, while the full form of DFS is Depth-First Search.
BFS finds the shortest path to the destination, whereas DFS goes to the bottom of a subtree, then backtracks.
What is Recursion?
Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself.
What are linear and non linear data Structures?
Linear:In linear data structure, data elements are sequentially connected and each element is traversable through
a single run.
Non-linear:In non-linear data structure, data elements are hierarchically connected and are present at various levels.
What is Big-(O)-notation?
Big O notation is the language we use for talking about how long an algorithm takes to run.
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
Types Of Time Complexity :
Best Time Complexity: Define the input for which algorithm takes less time or minimum time. In the best case calculate
the lower bound of an algorithm. Example: In the linear search when search data is present at the first location of
large data then the best case occurs.
Average Time Complexity: In the average case take all random inputs and calculate the computation time for all inputs.
And then we divide it by the total number of inputs.
Worst Time Complexity: Define the input for which algorithm takes a long time or maximum time. In the worst calculate
 the upper bound of an algorithm. Example: In the linear search when search data is present at the last location of
 large data then the worst case occurs.
Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and
disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
There are various types of data structure available like arrays,Linked List,Trees,graphs,stacks, queues and hash
table.
Advantages:-
1) Allows easier processing of data.
2) It allows information stored on disk very efficiently.
3) These are necessary for designing an efficient algorithm.
4) We can access data anytime and anywhere.
5) It is secure way of storage of  data.
6) Graphs models real life problems
Disadvantages:-
1) It is applicable only for advanced users.
2) If any issue occurs it can be solved only by experts.
3) Slow access in case of some data types
